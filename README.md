# NeoVim IDE

A very simple set of configurations and scripts for setting up NeoVim as a fully-fledged development environment.

> I'm allowing this to be public just in case some of these files solve a problem for somebody else. This is my own environment very carefully tailored to my own needs and projects. Suggestions are welcome, but please fork rather than request a merge.

Tested on Arch/Manjaro Linux. Any distribution should work so long as the underlying binaries can be found and installed. 

May work on MacOS.
