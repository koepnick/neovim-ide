# NeoVim IDE

> I'm allowing this to be public just in case some of these files solve a problem for somebody else. This is my own environment very carefully tailored to my own needs and projects. Suggestions are welcome, but please fork rather than pull request.

Tested on Arch/Manjaro Linux. Any distribution should work so long as the underlying binaries can be found and installed. 

May work on MacOS.

A very simple set of configurations and scripts for setting up NeoVim as a fully-fledged development environment.
